<p id="p01">The red zones on the map are always heavily populated with bandits who want and will kill you for what you have or just for fun. So be extra careful when moving around in these zones</p>
<p id="p02">The yellow zone has a fair amount of loot and you are less likely to encounter bandits</p>
